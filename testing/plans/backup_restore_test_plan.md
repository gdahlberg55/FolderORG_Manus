- Selective restoration capability

### Testing Types
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- UI testing

## Test Environment

### Test Environment Requirements
- Development workstation with Windows 10/11
- Test file set (minimum 10,000 files of various types)
- Network share for remote file testing
- Limited permission folders for permission testing

### Test Data
- Small file set (<100 files)
- Medium file set (1,000-5,000 files)
- Large file set (>10,000 files)
- Various file types (documents, images, executables, etc.)
- Files with special characters in names
- Long path files (>200 characters)
- Locked files

## Test Cases

### Transaction-Based Operations

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Results | Status |
|----|-----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| T01 | Create transaction | 1. Initialize FileOperationTransaction<br>2. Add file operations<br>3. Validate transaction state | Transaction is created with correct operations | Not Started |
| T02 | Execute transaction | 1. Create transaction<br>2. Execute transaction<br>3. Verify file system changes | Files are correctly moved/copied as specified | Not Started |
| T03 | Transaction rollback | 1. Create and execute transaction<br>2. Rollback transaction<br>3. Verify file system state | All changes are reverted to original state | Not Started |
| T04 | Transaction with locked files | 1. Create transaction with locked files<br>2. Execute transaction<br>3. Verify handling | Transaction fails gracefully, reports locked files | Not Started |
| T05 | Batch transaction | 1. Create transaction with >1000 operations<br>2. Execute transaction<br>3. Measure performance | Transaction completes in acceptable time (<30s) | Not Started |

### State Snapshots

| R02 | Retrieve restore points | 1. Create multiple restore points<br>2. Query by date range<br>3. Verify results | Correct restore points are returned | Not Started |
| R03 | Filter restore points | 1. Create restore points with different attributes<br>2. Filter by attributes<br>3. Verify results | Filtering works as expected | Not Started |
| R04 | Validate integrity | 1. Create restore point<br>2. Modify backup files<br>3. Attempt restoration | System detects integrity issues | Not Started |

### User Restoration Interface

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Results | Status |
|----|-----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| U01 | Display restore points | 1. Open RestorePointSelectionView<br>2. Verify UI elements<br>3. Check data binding | Restore points displayed correctly | Not Started |
| U02 | Filter restore points in UI | 1. Add filter criteria<br>2. Apply filter<br>3. Verify displayed points | UI shows only matching restore points | Not Started |
| U03 | Preview restore | 1. Select restore point<br>2. Open preview<br>3. Verify file list | Preview shows correct files to restore | Not Started |
| U04 | Detect conflicts | 1. Set up conflict scenario<br>2. Preview restore<br>3. Verify conflict detection | Conflicts are correctly identified | Not Started |
| U05 | Resolve conflicts | 1. Identify conflicts<br>2. Choose resolution strategy<br>3. Apply resolution | Conflicts resolved according to strategy | Not Started |

### Selective Restoration

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Results | Status |
|----|-----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| SR01 | Select files in preview | 1. Open preview<br>2. Select specific files<br>3. Verify selection state | File selection persists correctly | Not Started |
| SR02 | Select all/none | 1. Open preview with multiple files<br>2. Use select all/none<br>3. Verify selection state | All/no files selected as expected | Not Started |
| SR03 | Filter by type | 1. Open preview with mixed files<br>2. Filter by file type<br>3. Verify filtered view | Only matching files displayed | Not Started |
| SR04 | Partial restore | 1. Select subset of files<br>2. Execute restore<br>3. Verify only selected files restored | Only selected files are restored | Not Started |
| SR05 | Custom restore location | 1. Select files<br>2. Set custom target location<br>3. Execute restore<br>4. Verify location | Files restored to specified location | Not Started |

## Performance Tests

| ID | Test Case | Target Performance | Status |
|----|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| P01 | Large transaction execution | <30s for 1000 files | Not Started |
