## Current Status
The project has progressed well into active development with approximately 70% implementation completion. The core classification engine, file operations, Memory Bank system, and Rules Engine are fully functional with optimizations for performance and reliability. The UI now provides comprehensive file operations with visualization, filtering, and progress reporting.

Recent focus has been on enhancing the path validation system for rule target paths and implementing the rollback functionality in the backup/restore system. Performance optimizations have been made for large file operations and rule evaluation.

## New Documents Created
- **project_structure.md**: Comprehensive project structure organization
- **update_mechanism.md**: Detailed design for the application update system
- **solution_validation.md**: Complete solution validation and review
- **memory_bank_system.md**: Architecture and implementation details for the Memory Bank
- **rules_engine.md**: Design and implementation of the Rules Engine system
- **performance_optimization.md**: Strategies and implementation for system performance
- **path_validation_system.md**: Approach for validating rule target paths

## Known Issues
1. Performance bottlenecks when scanning extremely large directories (>500,000 files)
2. Metadata extraction fails for some specialized file formats
3. Memory usage peaks during heavy batch file operations
4. Path validation needs standardization for variable resolution
5. UI responsiveness issues during concurrent file operations
6. Backup data serialization performance for large histories

## Next Milestones
1. **Path Validation Completion (Week 2)**: Complete path validation system for rule targets
2. **Backup/Restore Functionality (Week 4)**: Finish rollback and UI components
3. **UI Statistics Enhancement (Week 6)**: Add Memory Bank statistics visualization
4. **Content Classification (Week 8)**: Improve content-based classification 
5. **Beta Release (Week 10)**: Feature-complete with initial testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from XML to JSON for configuration files due to better library support
- Chose SQLite over file-based storage for rule definitions to support complex queries
- Added ML.NET component for content classification after determining basic classification was insufficient
- Expanded scope of backup/restore system based on early testing feedback
- Adopted clean architecture approach with feature-based organization for better maintainability
- Created comprehensive validation process to ensure quality before implementation
- Implemented Memory Bank system with JSON storage for tracking organization history
- Optimized file scanning operations for large directories based on performance testing
- Added responsive UI layouts for different screen sizes
- Enhanced thread safety in Memory Bank and Rules Engine for concurrent operations
