## Current Status
The project has progressed well into active development with approximately 75% implementation completion. The core classification engine, file operations, Memory Bank system, Rules Engine, and Path Validation System are fully functional with optimizations for performance and reliability. The UI now provides comprehensive file operations with visualization, filtering, and progress reporting.

Recent focus has been on completing the Backup/Restore system and improving project organization. The transaction-based operations, state snapshots, and restore points are now fully implemented, with the user restoration interface at 80% completion focusing on the selective restoration capability. The project structure has been reorganized with dedicated folders for documentation, deliverables, and testing materials, each with comprehensive README files for improved navigation.

## Known Issues
1. Performance bottlenecks when scanning extremely large directories (>500,000 files)
2. Metadata extraction fails for some specialized file formats
3. Memory usage peaks during heavy batch file operations
4. UI responsiveness issues during concurrent file operations
5. Backup data serialization performance for large histories

## Next Milestones
1. **Backup/Restore Functionality (Week 4)**: Finish selective restoration capability
2. **UI Statistics Enhancement (Week 6)**: Add Memory Bank statistics visualization
3. **Content Classification (Week 8)**: Improve content-based classification 
4. **Beta Release (Week 10)**: Feature-complete with initial testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from XML to JSON for configuration files due to better library support
- Chose SQLite over file-based storage for rule definitions to support complex queries
- Added ML.NET component for content classification after determining basic classification was insufficient
- Expanded scope of backup/restore system based on early testing feedback
- Adopted clean architecture approach with feature-based organization for better maintainability
- Created comprehensive validation process to ensure quality before implementation
- Implemented Memory Bank system with JSON storage for tracking organization history
- Optimized file scanning operations for large directories based on performance testing
- Added responsive UI layouts for different screen sizes
- Enhanced thread safety in Memory Bank and Rules Engine for concurrent operations
- Implemented comprehensive Path Validation System with support for environment variables, custom variables, format validation, permission checking, and automatic directory creation
- Implemented RelayCommand pattern for MVVM architecture in the UI layer
- Reorganized project structure with dedicated folders for documentation, deliverables, and testing
