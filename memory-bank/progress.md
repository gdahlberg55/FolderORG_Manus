## Recent Achievements

1. Completed Backup/Restore System with selective restoration capability (100%)
2. Implemented parallel processing for large restore operations
3. Added comprehensive conflict resolution strategies
4. Improved RestorePreviewView with filtering and search functionality
5. Started implementation of Statistics Dashboard data models and visualization components

## Current Focus

Primary development focus is now on the **UI Statistics Dashboard** (10% complete):
- Creating data visualization components for file organization history
- Implementing file type distribution charts
- Developing operation timeline view
- Building performance metrics display
- Designing interactive filtering controls

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete basic UI Statistics Dashboard (expected: +2 weeks)
2. Implement advanced filtering for statistics views (expected: +3 weeks)
3. Begin development of content-based classification (expected: +4 weeks)
4. Increase test coverage to 70% (ongoing)
5. Complete user documentation for all features (ongoing)

## Known Issues

1. Memory usage spikes during large file operations - under investigation
2. UI responsiveness issues when processing >10,000 files - optimization in progress
3. Rare concurrency issue in parallel restore operations - being addressed
