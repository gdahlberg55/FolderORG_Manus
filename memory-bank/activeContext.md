## Key Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Interface-first development approach
- Heavy use of extension methods for utility functions
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and file operations
- **Repository pattern for data access**
- **Command pattern for file operations**
- **Strategy pattern for rule condition evaluation**
- **Observer pattern for progress reporting**

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for public classes and methods
- camelCase for private/internal fields
- Descriptive, verbose naming preferred over brevity
- "I" prefix for interfaces, "Service" suffix for service classes
- **"Manager" suffix for coordination classes**
- **"Result" suffix for operation return objects**
- **"Builder" suffix for fluent API classes**
- **"Factory" suffix for creation classes**

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for file system operations
- UI automation tests for critical user flows
- Test data generation with realistic file samples
- **Mock services for testing complex interactions**
- **Parameterized tests for condition evaluation**
- **Snapshot testing for UI components**

## Project Insights
- File metadata extraction is more complex than anticipated due to variety of formats
- Rule expression complexity requires careful balance between power and usability
- Safety mechanisms need thorough testing to prevent data loss scenarios
- Performance will be critical for user satisfaction with large file collections
- Memory Bank system provides valuable insights into organization patterns
- UI responsiveness during file operations requires careful threading management
- JSON serialization performance is sufficient for current needs
- Path resolution in rule target paths requires standardized approach to variables
- Rule templates significantly improve user experience for common scenarios
