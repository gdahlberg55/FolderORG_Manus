# FolderORG Manus - Active Development Context

## Current Focus
**UI Statistics Dashboard Development (10% Complete)**

Primary focus has shifted to developing a comprehensive statistics dashboard that will visualize file organization patterns and system performance metrics. This component will provide users with valuable insights into their file management habits and system effectiveness.

Key priorities:
- Creating data models for statistics aggregation
- Implementing visualization components for organization history
- Designing file type distribution charts
- Building operation timeline views

## Recently Completed
**Backup/Restore System (100%)**

The Backup/Restore system is now fully implemented with all planned features, including:
- Selective restoration capability allowing users to choose specific files to restore
- Advanced filtering and search in the RestorePreviewView
- Parallel processing optimizations for large restore operations
- Comprehensive conflict resolution strategies
- Thread-safe operations in the RestorePointService

Recent enhancements include:
- Improved RestorePreviewView with filtering and search functionality
- Enhanced RestorePreviewViewModel with selection capabilities
- Implementation of RestoreOptions for customizable restoration behavior
- Addition of progress reporting with cancellation support
- Conflict resolution strategies at both global and per-file levels

## Next Steps

1. **UI Statistics Dashboard (10%)**
   - Complete data model for statistics aggregation (25% done)
   - Implement organization history charts (10% done)
   - Design file type distribution visualization
   - Create operation timeline view
   - Add performance metrics display

2. **Content-based Classification**
   - Research ML.NET integration possibilities
   - Develop content pattern matching algorithms
   - Create training pipeline for classification models
   - Implement integration with existing classification system

3. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Increase unit test coverage (currently 50%)
   - Add integration tests for the completed Backup/Restore system
   - Implement UI automation tests for critical workflows
   - Create performance benchmarks

## Implementation Details

### UI Statistics Dashboard
The dashboard will provide visual representations of file organization activities, using:
- Material Design charting components
- MVVM pattern with isolated viewmodels
- Aggregation services for data collection
- Real-time updates for active operations

### Content-based Classification
This feature will allow the system to analyze file contents to determine appropriate organization rules:
- Text-based pattern matching for documents
- Image recognition for visual files
- Metadata extraction for media files
- Custom analyzers for specific file types

### Recent Pull Requests
- PR #52: Complete Backup/Restore System with Selective Restoration (MERGED)
- PR #53: Parallel Processing Optimizations (MERGED)
- PR #54: Initial Statistics Dashboard Structure (IN REVIEW)

## Performance Optimizations
Current performance improvements being implemented:
- Batch processing for file operations
- Caching of frequent file metadata queries
- Progressive loading of large directory contents
- Background processing for non-critical operations

## Integration Points
- **Memory Bank System**: Updated to track restore operations and their outcomes
- **Rules Engine**: No direct integration with restoration capability
- **File Operations**: Enhanced with parallel processing and transaction support
- **UI Layer**: Updated with filtering and selection capabilities

## Patterns Used
- **Parallel Processing Pattern**: Implemented for large file operations
- **Transaction Pattern**: Used for atomic file operations
- **Repository Pattern**: Applied for restore point storage
- **MVVM Pattern**: Enhanced with filtering capabilities
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for conflict resolution options

## Current Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Added for RestorePointService and RestoreOptions
- **Integration Tests**: Created for the restore process flow
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring restore times with and without parallel processing
- **Visual Testing**: Manual validation of UI components

## Resources
- **Documentation**: Updated architecture diagrams for Backup/Restore system
- **Code References**: 
  - `IRestorePointService.cs` in Core/Interfaces
  - `RestorePointService.cs` in Infrastructure/Services
  - `RestorePreviewViewModel.cs` in UI/ViewModels
  - `RestorePreviewView.xaml` in UI/Views

## Development Timeline
- **Week 4-5**: Complete Backup/Restore System with Selective Restoration âœ“
- **Week 6-7**: Implement UI Statistics Dashboard (in progress)
- **Week 8-9**: Develop Content-based Classification
- **Week 10**: Prepare for Beta Release

## Technical Challenges
1. **Performance optimization** for large file sets during restoration
2. **Memory management** during parallel processing operations
3. **UI responsiveness** during long-running restore operations
4. **Thread safety** for concurrent operations in services

## Recent Decisions
1. Implemented parallel processing for file operations to improve performance on large file sets
2. Created RestoreOptions class for more configurable and flexible restoration behavior
3. Enhanced UI with filtering capabilities for better user experience with large backups
4. Added progress reporting with cancel support for long-running operations

## Notes
- The Backup/Restore System is now fully functional and optimized for performance
- Parallel processing implementation shows significant improvements for large file sets
- All planned backup/restore functionality has been successfully implemented
- Next major focus will be on UI statistics visualization and reporting
