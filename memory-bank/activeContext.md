# Active Development Context

## Current Focus: Backup/Restore System - Selective Restoration

### Overview
We are currently implementing the selective restoration capability for the Backup/Restore System. This feature allows users to choose specific files to restore rather than restoring entire transactions. The implementation is about 80% complete with the core framework in place and the selective UI components in development.

### Project Organization Update
The project has been reorganized with a more structured directory layout:
- `docs/` - Project documentation
  - `architecture/` - Architectural documentation
  - `components/` - Component-specific documentation
- `deliverables/` - Project deliverables
  - `documentation/` - User and technical documentation
  - `specifications/` - Project specifications
- `testing/` - Testing documentation
  - `plans/` - Test plans and strategies
  - `results/` - Test results and reports

Each directory includes a README.md file explaining its purpose and contents. This organization provides better separation of concerns and clearer navigation through project materials.

### Key Components in Development

#### UI Components
- **RestorePointSelectionView**: Complete - Allows users to browse and select restore points
- **RestorePointSelectionViewModel**: Complete - Provides data and commands for the selection view
- **RestorePreviewView**: 80% Complete - Shows preview of files to be restored
- **RestorePreviewViewModel**: 80% Complete - Adding selection tracking and commands
- **SelectableFilePreview**: 80% Complete - Enhancing with selection state
- **SelectableConflict**: Complete - Model for conflict resolution

#### Domain Services
- **IRestorePointService**: 90% Complete - Adding partial restore methods
- **RestorePointService**: 80% Complete - Implementing partial restore functionality
- **IFileTransactionService**: Complete - Interface for transaction management
- **JsonFileTransactionService**: Complete - Implementation with JSON storage

#### Infrastructure
- **FileOperationTransaction**: Complete - Model for tracking transaction details
- **RestorePoint**: Complete - Model with comprehensive metadata
- **TransactionStorage**: Complete - Persistence mechanism for transactions
- **SnapshotManager**: Complete - Handles state snapshots

### Recent Implementation: MVVM Infrastructure
- Added **RelayCommand** and **RelayCommand<T>** classes to support the MVVM pattern
- Implemented in `src/FolderORG.Manus.UI/Commands/RelayCommand.cs`
- Provides command binding for view models with support for:
  - Execution logic via delegates
  - Can-execute conditions
  - Command parameter passing
  - CanExecuteChanged event notification

### Recent Implementation: Project Organization
- Created organized folder structure for project deliverables and documentation
- Added comprehensive test plan for Backup/Restore System in `testing/plans/`
- Created test result templates in `testing/results/`
- Added component documentation structure in `docs/components/`
- Updated README.md files throughout the project for better navigation

### Implementation Plan for Selective Restoration

#### Week 4: Complete Selective Restoration
1. Enhance RestorePreviewView with selection UI
   - Add checkboxes for individual items
   - Implement select all/none functionality
   - Create file type filtering
   
2. Update RestorePreviewViewModel
   - Add selection tracking properties
   - Implement filtering commands
   - Create commands for partial restore
   
3. Modify RestorePointService
   - Implement partial restore methods
   - Add transaction support for selective operations
   - Create target path customization

#### Week 5: Testing and Refinement
1. Add unit tests for selective restoration
2. Create integration tests for the entire restoration flow
3. Perform manual testing with various scenarios
4. Optimize performance for large restore operations

#### Week 6: UI Enhancements
1. Add visual progress indicators
2. Implement file difference visualization
3. Enhance conflict resolution dialog
4. Add detailed restore history

### Integration Points
- The Backup/Restore System interfaces with:
  - **File Operation Service**: For executing file system operations
  - **Memory Bank**: For tracking operation history
  - **Path Validation System**: For validating target paths

### Code Structure and Patterns
- Following Clean Architecture principles
- Using MVVM pattern for UI components
- Implementing Repository pattern for data access
- Using Strategy pattern for different restore operations
- Applying Memento pattern for transaction state management

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services and view models
- Integration tests for end-to-end restore operations
- Manual testing for UI components
- Performance testing for large restore operations

## Next Development Focus
After completing the Backup/Restore System, the next focus will be:

1. **UI Statistics Enhancement**:
   - Implementing visualization dashboard
   - Adding Memory Bank data filtering
   - Creating export functionality

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Completing large batch processing improvements
   - Enhancing rule evaluation for large rule sets

3. **Content-based Classification**:
   - Enhancing ML.NET integration
   - Implementing content pattern matching
