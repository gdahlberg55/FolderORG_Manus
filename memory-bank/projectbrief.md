# Project Brief: FolderORG Manus

## Project Overview
FolderORG Manus is an intelligent file and folder organization system designed to help users automatically organize their digital content based on customizable rules and patterns. The system analyzes file metadata and content to intelligently categorize and structure files, reducing digital clutter and improving productivity.

## Core Requirements
1. **Automated File Organization**: Scan and categorize files based on type, content, and metadata
2. **Customizable Rules Engine**: Allow users to define and modify organization rules
3. **Intelligent Classification**: Use patterns to identify file types and appropriate destinations
4. **Folder Structure Templates**: Provide standard organization templates for common use cases
5. **Backup & Restore**: Ensure data safety with backup/restore functionality
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive UI for all user experience levels
7. **System Protection**: Safeguards to prevent critical system file disruption
8. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing for large file collections
9. **Memory Bank System**: Track organization history and provide insights
10. **Path Validation**: Comprehensive validation of target paths with variable resolution
11. **Multi-classifier System**: Support for various classification strategies
12. **Template Management**: Creation and modification of organization templates

## Project Goals
- Create an efficient system that reduces time spent manually organizing files
- Maintain flexibility for users with diverse organization needs
- Ensure data integrity and prevent accidental data loss
- Provide clear visibility into the organization process
- Build an expandable architecture that can incorporate future enhancements
- Deliver a high-performance solution that works efficiently with large file collections
- Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Support different organization styles through customizable rules and templates
- Create a visually appealing UI with modern design principles
- Develop a system that learns from user behavior to improve organization over time

## Success Criteria
- Reduction in time spent manually organizing files by at least 70%
- High accuracy in file classification (>95%)
- Positive user feedback on interface intuitiveness
- System stability with no data corruption or loss
- Ability to handle diverse file types and organization schemes
- Efficient performance with large file collections (>100,000 files)
- Comprehensive rule evaluation with minimal conflicts
- Effective path validation with variable resolution
- Reliable backup and restore functionality
- Detailed organization history through Memory Bank system

## Constraints
- Must be resource-efficient to avoid system slowdowns
- Should work with standard file systems
- Must respect user privacy and security
- Initial version targets Windows operating systems
- Should handle file system limitations (path length, permissions, etc.)
- Must work within user permission boundaries
- Should respect file locks and access restrictions
- Must maintain backward compatibility for rule definitions

## Technical Requirements
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Asynchronous operations for UI responsiveness
- Thread safety for concurrent operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Efficient file system operations
- Pluggable classification system
- Flexible rule evaluation engine
- JSON-based configuration and storage
- Material Design-based user interface
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing

## Key Features
- **Classification Engine**: Multiple classifiers for different file properties
- **Rules Engine**: Condition-based rule system with action framework
- **Memory Bank**: Organization history and statistics tracking
- **Folder Templates**: Predefined and custom organization structures
- **Path Validation**: Variable resolution and path validation
- **Backup System**: Operation history with rollback capability
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing for large collections
- **Statistics Visualization**: Visual representation of organization patterns
- **Template System**: Quick-start organization with templates
- **Content Analysis**: Basic content-based classification

## Timeline
- **Planning & Design Phase**: 1 month
- **Core Implementation**: 3 months
- **Feature Enhancement**: 2 months
- **Testing & Refinement**: 2 months
- **Documentation & Deployment**: 1 month
- **Total Project Duration**: 9 months

## Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Primary beneficiaries of the organization system
- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementation and testing
- **Product Manager**: Oversees project direction and requirements
- **UX Designer**: Ensures intuitive user experience
- **QA Team**: Validates system functionality and stability
- **Documentation Team**: Creates user and technical documentation

## Risk Factors
- Performance degradation with extremely large file collections
- Complexity in rule conflict resolution
- User resistance to automated organization
- File system permission issues
- Integration challenges with specialized file types
- Balancing flexibility with ease of use
- Ensuring data safety during file operations
- Managing memory usage with large rule sets
