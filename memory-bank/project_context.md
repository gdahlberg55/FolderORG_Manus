# FolderORG Manus - Project Context

## Project Overview
FolderORG Manus is an intelligent file organization system that automatically categorizes and structures files based on customizable rules and patterns. The system uses multiple classification strategies including extension-based, size-based, date-based, and content-based approaches to organize files according to user-defined rules.

## Current Development Focus
**UI Statistics Dashboard (10% Complete)**

The current implementation focus is on developing a comprehensive statistics dashboard to visualize file organization history, type distributions, and operation timelines. This feature will provide users with insights into their file organization patterns and system performance.

## Recent Project Cleanup
The project has undergone a significant file organization cleanup:
- Removed duplicate documentation files from the root directory
- Moved architecture documentation to `docs/architecture/`
- Moved component documentation to `docs/components/`
- Improved navigation with a cleaner root directory
- Maintained the same content while eliminating redundancy

## Project Organization
The project follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

## Key Components

### UI Statistics Dashboard
The dashboard will provide visual representations of file organization activities, type distributions, and performance metrics.

**Components:**
- Organization History Charts: Visual representation of file organization over time
- File Type Distribution: Breakdown of managed files by type and category
- Operation Timeline: Chronological view of system operations and their outcomes
- Performance Metrics: Visualization of operation durations and efficiency

### Backup/Restore System
The system provides robust transaction-based file operations with rollback capability and user-friendly restoration interface. Now complete with selective restoration capabilities.

**Components:**
- Transaction-Based Operations: Model for tracking transaction details and execution
- State Snapshots: Creating and verifying snapshots of file system state
- Restore Points: Creation, retrieval, and filtering of restore points
- User Restoration Interface: UI for browsing, previewing, and executing restores
- Selective Restoration: Ability to choose specific files to restore with filtering options
- Parallel Processing: Performance optimization for large restore operations

### Path Validation System
Provides comprehensive file and directory path validation with robust support for path normalization, variable resolution, and permission checking.

### Rules Engine
Implements condition-based rule system with action framework, JSON-based storage, and fluent API for defining organization rules.

### Memory Bank System
Tracks operation history, provides statistics, and maintains metadata for performed file operations.

## Recent Implementation
- Completed Backup/Restore System with selective restoration capability
- Added parallel processing for improved performance with large file sets
- Implemented filtering and search in RestorePreviewView
- Created RestoreOptions class for configurable restoration behavior
- Enhanced conflict resolution with per-file and global strategies
- Added progress reporting with cancellation support
- Implemented thread-safe operations in RestorePointService

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **UI Statistics Enhancement (Week 6)**: Complete Memory Bank statistics visualization
2. **Content Classification (Week 8)**: Improve content-based classification
3. **Beta Release (Week 10)**: Feature-complete with comprehensive testing

## Known Issues
1. Performance bottlenecks when scanning extremely large directories (>500,000 files)
2. Metadata extraction fails for some specialized file formats
3. Memory usage peaks during heavy batch file operations
4. UI responsiveness issues during concurrent file operations
5. Backup data serialization performance for large histories

## Technical Stack
- C# (.NET 6.0)
- WPF with Material Design for UI
- MVVM architecture pattern
- JSON for configuration storage
- SQLite for rule definitions
- ML.NET for content classification

## Key Project Decisions
- JSON chosen over XML for configuration files (better library support)
- SQLite over file-based storage for rule definitions (complex queries)
- Clean architecture approach with feature-based organization
- Memory Bank system with JSON storage for tracking history
- Path Validation System with variable resolution and permission checking
- MVVM pattern with RelayCommand implementation
- Structured project organization with dedicated documentation directories
- Parallel processing for file operations to improve performance
- Configurable restoration options for flexibility
