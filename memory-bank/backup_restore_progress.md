# Backup/Restore System Progress

## Overview
The Backup/Restore System implementation for FolderORG Manus is now 90% complete, providing robust transaction-based file operations with rollback capability and a user-friendly restoration interface. This component is critical for ensuring data safety during file organization operations and allowing users to recover from unintended changes.

  - ⏳ Creating partial restore logic in the RestorePointService

### Integration with Core Components
- ✅ Integrated with FileOperationService
- ✅ Added service registration in dependency injection system
- ✅ Implemented thread safety with SemaphoreSlim
- ✅ Added support for cancellation tokens in long-running operations
- ✅ Created support for progress reporting during operations

## Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Added in-memory caching for transactions
- ✅ Implemented efficient file verification using hashing
- ✅ Created transactional batching for better performance
- ✅ Added support for concurrent operations with proper locking
- ✅ Implemented efficient serialization/deserialization

## MVVM Implementation
- ✅ Implemented RelayCommand and RelayCommand<T> classes
- ✅ Created ViewModelBase with INotifyPropertyChanged support
- ✅ Added RestorePointSelectionViewModel for restore point listing and filtering
- ✅ Implemented RestorePreviewViewModel for restore previewing
- ✅ Created SelectableFilePreview and SelectableConflict models for UI display
- ⏳ Implementing selection tracking in view models

## Next Steps

### Selective Restoration (Week 4)
- Enhance RestorePreviewView to support per-file selection
  - Add checkbox support for each item in the preview
  - Implement Select All/None functionality
  - Create selection filtering by file type or folder
- Implement partial restore functionality in RestorePointService
  - Create filtered restore operations based on selection
  - Add transaction support for partial restores
  - Implement restore target customization
- Add file filtering capability for large restore operations
  - Create search functionality in the preview
  - Add type-based filtering
  - Implement folder-based grouping

### Testing (Weeks 5-6)
- Add comprehensive unit tests for transaction operations
- Create integration tests for restore functionality
- Develop performance benchmarks for large operations
- Test edge cases for rollback scenarios

### UI Enhancements (Weeks 6-7)
- Add visual progress indicators during restoration
- Implement file difference visualization for preview
- Create detailed conflict resolution dialog
- Add restore history view

### Final Integration (Weeks 8-9)
- Connect to the main application workflow
- Add automatic restore point creation before batch operations
- Implement scheduled backup of application configuration
- Create user documentation for the restore system

## Architecture Details

The Backup/Restore System follows the Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Layer**: Defines interfaces (`IFileTransactionService`, `IRestorePointService`) and domain models (`FileOperationTransaction`, `RestorePoint`, etc.)
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic for transaction processing and restoration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides implementation (`JsonFileTransactionService`) with JSON-based persistence
- **UI Layer**: Offers user interface components (`RestorePointSelectionView`, `RestorePreviewView`) following MVVM pattern

The system uses the Memento pattern for transaction state management and the Strategy pattern for restore operations, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

## Current Implementation Focus

The current focus is on implementing the selective restoration capability, which allows users to choose specific files to restore rather than restoring entire transactions. This requires:

1. Enhancing the UI to support item selection (checkboxes, select all/none buttons)
2. Extending the view models to track selection state
3. Modifying the RestorePointService to support partial restores
4. Implementing efficient filtering mechanisms for large restore operations

We're implementing these changes in the following files:
- `RestorePreviewViewModel.cs`: Adding selection tracking and commands
- `RestorePreviewView.xaml`: Adding selection UI elements
- `SelectableFilePreview.cs`: Enhancing with selection state
- `IRestorePointService.cs`: Adding partial restore methods
- `RestorePointService.cs`: Implementing partial restore functionality

## Conclusion

The Backup/Restore System provides a robust foundation for safe file operations in FolderORG Manus. With transaction-based operations, comprehensive state snapshots, and an intuitive user interface, users can confidently organize their files knowing they can always restore previous states if needed. The remaining work focuses primarily on enhancing the selective restoration capability and final integration with the main application workflow.
