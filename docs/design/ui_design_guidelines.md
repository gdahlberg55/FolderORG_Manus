# UI Design Guidelines

## Core Design Principles

Our application adheres to modern UI design principles with a focus on aesthetics, usability, and brand recognition. These guidelines ensure a consistent, professional, and contemporary appearance throughout the application.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Modern Aesthetics**: Ensure the application never appears dated or old-fashioned
2. **Intuitive Experience**: Design for clarity and ease of use
3. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain recognizable visual identity
4. **Professional Appearance**: Present a polished, high-quality interface
5. **Responsive Design**: Adapt gracefully to different window sizes

## Material Design Implementation

We follow Google's Material Design principles while maintaining our unique brand identity. Material Design provides a solid foundation for modern UI development with its focus on tactile surfaces, meaningful animation, and depth effects.

### Key Material Design Elements

- **Elevation & Shadows**: Use subtle shadows to create visual hierarchy
- **Surface Architecture**: Design UI components as physical surfaces
- **Thoughtful Motion**: Implement purposeful animations that enhance understanding
- **Color & Contrast**: Employ deliberate color usage that supports accessibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide immediate, clear feedback for user interactions

## Layout Guidelines

### Spacing & Density

- **Whitespace**: Embrace generous whitespace (minimum 16px between major elements)
- **Content Density**: Maintain a medium-density UI that balances information display with visual comfort
- **Consistent Margins**: Standard margins throughout the application:
  - Layout margins: 24px
  - Content margins: 16px
  - Element spacing: 8px increments

### Grid System

- Implement an 8px baseline grid for all components
- Align elements to a 12-column responsive grid
- Major UI sections should align to the grid system

### Visual Hierarchy

- **3-Level Hierarchy**: Implement primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of importance
- **Size Contrast**: Use size differentiation to denote importance (titles: 20pt, body: 14pt, captions: 12pt)
- **Visual Weight**: More important elements should have greater visual weight through color, size, or position

## Typography

### Font Selection

- **Primary Font**: Roboto for all UI elements
- **Monospace Font**: Roboto Mono for code or technical content
- **Fallback Stack**: Sans-serif

### Type Scale

- **Display (Large)**: 34px
- **Display (Medium)**: 24px
- **Title**: 20px
- **Subtitle**: 16px
- **Body**: 14px
- **Caption**: 12px
- **Button Text**: 14px

### Text Rules

- Line height: 1.5 times font size
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Paragraph spacing: 1.5 times the text size

## Color System

### Base Palette

- **Primary Color**: [TBD based on branding]
- **Secondary Color**: [TBD based on branding]
- **Surface Colors**: Light theme - #FFFFFF, Dark theme - #121212
- **Background Colors**: Light theme - #F5F5F5, Dark theme - #1E1E1E

### Functional Colors

- **Success**: #4CAF50
- **Warning**: #FF9800
- **Error**: #F44336
- **Info**: #2196F3

### Color Application Rules

- Limit accent colors to 10% of UI surface area
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Use color consistently across similar elements
- Implement both light and dark themes with appropriate contrast

## Component Design

### Buttons

- **Primary Button**: Filled with primary color, high emphasis
- **Secondary Button**: Outlined with clear boundaries
- **Text Button**: For non-critical actions
- **Floating Action Button**: For primary action on screen
- **Button Sizes**:
  - Standard: 36px height
  - Small: 24px height
  - Large: 48px height
- **Button States**: Include visual feedback for hover, pressed, focused, and disabled states

### Cards

- Border radius: 4-8px
- Card padding: 16px
- Shadow elevation: 1dp (resting), 8dp (raised)
- Clear visual separation between cards and background

### Forms & Inputs

- **Text Fields**: Outlined style for better visibility
- **Input Height**: 56px standard height
- **Helper Text**: 12px below inputs for guidance
- **Validation**: Clear error states with explanatory text
- **Selection Controls**: Switches for binary options, radio buttons for exclusive choices, checkboxes for multiple selections

### Navigation Elements

- **App Bar**: Fixed position with elevation
- **Navigation Drawer**: For primary navigation
- **Bottom Navigation**: Consider for frequently accessed sections
- **Tabs**: For related content within a section
- **Breadcrumbs**: For deep hierarchical navigation (especially in file operations)

### Lists & Tables

- **List Items**: 72px standard height for comfortable touch
- **Dividers**: Subtle 1px lines between items (optional)
- **Tables**: Zebra striping for readability of complex data
- **Row Hover**: Visual feedback on hover

## Motion & Animation

### Animation Principles

- **Purposeful**: Animations should guide attention and explain relationships
- **Natural**: Motion should feel natural and expected
- **Swift**: Keep animations fast (150-300ms) to not delay users

### Standard Transitions

- **Page Transitions**: Fade or slide (300ms)
- **Component Entry**: Fade in with slight scaling (150ms)
- **Hover Effects**: Quick fade (100ms)
- **Loading States**: Subtle animation for progress indicators

## Icons & Imagery

### Icons

- Use Material Design icon set as baseline
- Consistent 24px size for standard icons
- Clear optical alignment within bounding box
- Match icon weight with typography
- Use outlined icons for secondary actions, filled for primary

### Images & Graphics

- Consistent treatment of all images
- Proper scaling without distortion
- Alt text for accessibility
- Optimized file sizes for performance

## Accessibility

### Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard
- Proper color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard navigability for all interactions
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators for keyboard users

### Best Practices

- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Ensure touch targets are at least 48x48px
- Support text scaling up to 200%

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

- **Small**: <600px
- **Medium**: 600px - 960px
- **Large**: 960px - 1280px
- **Extra Large**: >1280px

### Responsive Behavior

- Fluid grids that adjust to window size
- Component reflow at breakpoints
- Critical actions always accessible
- Touch-friendly on all device sizes
- Test at various window dimensions

## [Brand Guidelines Placeholder]
