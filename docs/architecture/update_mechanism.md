# FolderORG Manus - Update Mechanism Design

## Overview

The update mechanism for FolderORG Manus provides automated, safe, and reliable application updates while preserving user settings and customizations. The system follows these core principles:

1. **Non-disruptive**: Updates occur with minimal interruption to the user experience
2. **Safe**: Data integrity is maintained throughout the update process
3. **Reversible**: Updates can be rolled back if problems occur
4. **Transparent**: Users are informed about available updates and their content
5. **Configurable**: Users control when and how updates are applied

## Components

### Update Service
- Windows service that runs in the background
- Periodically checks for updates based on user-configured schedule
- Handles background download of update packages
- Triggers UI notification when updates are available
- Can be configured to auto-install updates during non-use periods

### Update Manager
- Coordinates the entire update process
- Validates system state before update (disk space, permissions)
- Creates backup of critical files and configuration
- Manages update workflow (download, verify, install, verify, rollback if needed)
- Maintains update history log

### Update Repository
- Interfaces with the remote update server
- Retrieves update metadata (versions, requirements, release notes)
- Downloads update packages
- Verifies download integrity via checksums

### Package Verifier
- Validates update package signatures
- Verifies package contents against manifest
- Checks system compatibility
- Ensures all required components are present

### Backup Manager
- Creates configuration and data backups before updates
- Stores previous application versions for rollback
- Implements restore process if update fails
- Purges old backups based on retention policy

### Notification UI
- Non-intrusive notification of available updates
- Displays update details (version, features, fixes)
- Provides update scheduling options
- Shows update progress during installation
- Integrates with the main application UI

## Update Workflow

### Check for Updates
1. Update Service periodically connects to update server (default: daily)
2. Retrieves metadata for latest available version
3. Compares with installed version
4. If newer version available, downloads metadata (changelog, requirements)
5. Notifies user through Notification UI

### Download Update
1. Based on user preference (automatic or manual approval)
2. Update Repository downloads the update package
3. Package Verifier validates the package integrity and signature
4. Update is stored in a staging area

### Prepare for Update
1. Backup Manager creates backup of:
   - User configuration
   - Rules database
   - Templates
   - Custom settings
2. Update Manager validates system readiness
3. Application prepares for update (completes pending operations)

### Install Update
1. Application is closed (if running)
2. Update Manager extracts and installs update package
3. Registry entries and file associations are updated
4. Previous version is preserved for rollback
5. Database schema migrations are applied if needed

### Verify Update
1. Update Manager verifies successful installation
2. Configuration compatibility is checked
3. Basic functionality test is performed
4. If verification fails, rollback is initiated automatically

### Finalize Update
1. User is notified of successful update
2. Changelog is displayed on first launch after update
3. Update history is recorded
4. Old backup files are purged according to retention policy

## Technical Implementation

### Update Package Format
- MSIX package format for application updates
- Delta updates to minimize download size
- Signed packages with certificate verification
- Manifest with:
  - Version information
  - Required components
  - File checksums
  - Dependencies
  - Compatibility requirements

### Update Delivery
- HTTPS-based API for update discovery and download
- CDN distribution for efficient delivery
- Bandwidth throttling to minimize impact on system performance
- Resumable downloads for reliability

### Update Channels
- **Stable**: Production-ready releases with thorough testing
- **Beta**: Pre-release versions for early adopters
- **Development**: Optional channel for testing new features
- User-configurable channel selection

### Security Considerations
- Code signing for all update packages
- Secure HTTPS connections for all update operations
- Integrity verification via checksums
- Anti-tampering measures
- Privilege elevation only when required for installation

### Configurability Options
- Update frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, manual only)
- Automatic or manual download
- Automatic or manual installation
- Update channel selection
- Bandwidth limitations
- Update installation time (immediate, scheduled, at shutdown)
- Backup retention policy

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Automatic Rollback
- If application fails to start after update
- If critical functionality is detected as broken
- If database migration fails
- Upon explicit user request

### Manual Recovery
- Standalone recovery tool included with installation
- Option to reinstall previous version
- Configuration restoration utility
- Repair installation capability

## Testing Strategy

- Automated testing of update paths from each supported version
- Simulated failure scenarios to verify rollback
- Network interruption handling tests
- Permission and access control tests
- Cross-version configuration compatibility tests

## Deployment Strategy

The update mechanism will be included in the initial application release but will first undergo limited deployment:

1. **Internal Testing**: Developer team update testing
2. **Alpha Testing**: Limited external testing with monitoring
3. **Beta Channel**: Opt-in updates for early adopters
4. **General Availability**: Update system enabled for all users
