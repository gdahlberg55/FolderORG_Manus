# Automated Organization Process Design

## Overview
The Automated Organization Process is a core component of the File Organization Tool that schedules periodic scans, creates move plans, runs in the background with minimal resource usage, and logs all activities. This document outlines the design and implementation details for this automated system.

## 1. Scheduling System for Periodic Scans

### Scan Frequency Options

- **Predefined Schedules**
  - Daily: Run at specified time (default: 2:00 AM)
  - Weekly: Run on specified day and time (default: Sunday, 3:00 AM)
  - Monthly: Run on specified date and time (default: 1st day, 4:00 AM)
  - Quarterly: Run on first day of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
  - Custom: User-defined frequency and timing

- **Adaptive Scheduling**
  - System idle detection for opportunistic scanning
  - File change volume-based scheduling (more changes = more frequent scans)
  - User activity pattern learning (schedule during typical inactive periods)
  - Battery/power state awareness for mobile devices

- **Trigger-Based Scanning**
  - Storage threshold triggers (e.g., when disk usage exceeds 80%)
  - New device connection (e.g., external drive attached)
