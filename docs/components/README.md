# Component Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each major component of the FolderORG Manus system. Each document describes the design, implementation details, and usage patterns for a specific component.

## Component Documentation Files

| Component | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| File Classification Engine | file_classification_engine.md | Details the implementation of the file classification system, including extension-based, size-based, date-based, and content-based classification approaches. |
| Folder Structure System | folder_structure_system.md | Documents the folder template system, dynamic path resolution, and structure creation capabilities. |
| Backup/Restore System | configuration_backup_restore_system.md | Outlines the transaction-based operations, state snapshots, restore points, and user interface for the backup and restoration functionality. |
| Intelligent Cleanup System | intelligent_cleanup_system.md | Describes the unused file detection, staging system, notification framework, and retention policies for the cleanup functionality. |
| Automated Organization Process | automated_organization_process.md | Details the scheduling system, move plan generation, background processing, and activity logging for automated organization. |
| Path Validation System | path_validation_system.md | Located in the memory-bank directory, this document describes the comprehensive path validation, normalization, and variable resolution system. |
| Rules Engine | rules_engine.md | Located in the memory-bank directory, this document outlines the rule definition, parsing, execution, and conflict resolution components. |

## Usage Guidelines

1. Update component documentation when making significant changes to the implementation
2. Maintain a consistent structure across all component documentation:
   - Overview
   - Architecture
   - Features
   - Implementation Details
   - Integration Points
   - Performance Considerations
   - Future Improvements
3. Include code examples where appropriate
4. Reference related components when describing integration points
5. Document any breaking changes or API modifications
